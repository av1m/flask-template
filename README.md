# Flask template

This repository is a template for a simple flask project.
It does not use much blueprint by default because it wants to be light and fast.

This project allows you to deploy the application directly to a WSGI server (for example)
The [main.py](./main.py) file allows you to deploy on a serverless service such as Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions or Amazon Lambda.
